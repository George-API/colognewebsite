"Design a modern, clean, and minimal e-commerce website that prioritizes simplicity and user experience. The homepage should feature a sleek, full-width banner with bold typography and a high-quality image showcasing the product or service. Use a monochromatic or neutral color palette with subtle accents for contrast. Include a streamlined navigation bar with concise labels and a search bar for easy access.

The product pages should have ample white space, large product images, and clear, readable text. Highlight key details like price, description, and availability using a clean, sans-serif font. Add interactive elements like hover effects on buttons and product images. Incorporate a sticky 'Add to Cart' button for convenience. The cart and checkout process should be intuitive and straightforward, featuring clear calls to action and minimal distractions.

Ensure the website is fully responsive, loading quickly and adapting seamlessly to different devices. Focus on accessibility, ensuring all text is legible, buttons are easy to tap, and the layout is intuitive for users of all abilities."
